## 💡 Key Insights from the Dashboard

🔹 **Insight 1:**  
💻 **Technology** is the leading product category, contributing **36%** of total sales. It indicates strong interest in tech-related purchases.

🔹 **Insight 2:**  
🌍 The **West Region** dominates in total sales, reflecting better performance and possible market maturity in that area.

🔹 **Insight 3:**  
🎄 A significant **sales peak occurred in December**, revealing a clear **seasonal trend**—likely tied to year-end shopping.

🔹 **Insight 4:**  
📉 The **South Region** consistently reports the **lowest sales**, suggesting the need for targeted campaigns or product re-alignment.

💡 **Business Tip:**  
Focus marketing strategies on underperforming regions (like South), and prepare inventory in advance for December spikes.
